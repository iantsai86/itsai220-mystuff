# My stuff 

## Description
This is a simple go application that runs has 4 endpoints setup
```
/health: Returns a 200 OK status if service is healthy
/ready: Returns a 200 OK status and the service is ready to run.
/payload: Calculate a Fibonacci sequence to the random number and
return it as a JSON response with code 200.
/metrics: Returns basic metrics about the service's operation.
```
The service is running behind a loadbalancer to ensure traffic are distributed evenly as shown in this Grafana dashboard.

This service is deployed on kubernetes Deployment which has rolling upgrade incrementally replacing instances of the old version with instances of the new version which will provide us with zero-downtime deployment.
Also, we are using Helm to package it all into a chart, which provides version control and rollbacks and configuration management with values.yaml. With Helm you can also switch between deploying in Production or Develpment environments by adjust values or using ```--set``` switch. The best is this can all be integrated with a CI/CD pipelines for ease of deployments.

However, in this case with minikube, as we are developing everything locally, you have to set image pull policy to Never since we don't have this image pushing to a public registry.

## Building the service
Build steps are defined in Makefile.

To build go binary
```
make build 
```
To build the container 
```
make container
```
To build Helm chart
```
make helm
```

## Local Development
We will use minikube to run this service locally with images built by docker and deploy them using helm packages.

### Setup
If you don't have minikube setup, please follow the [installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) for your local machine

If you don't have docker setup, please follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your local machine

If you don't have helm setup, please follow the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for your local machine

To start minikube run
```
minikube start
```
Once you have ran ```make helm``` and built all the artifacts you can run ```make refresh-minikube-env``` to load your local image into minikube environment and helm install your service from locally built chart.
As there is a LoadBalancer set in the k8s services.yaml you will also need to run ```minikube tunnel``` on a separate terminal so minikube can setup an external IP with localhost IP.

To execute send requests test.go run 
```
make send-requests
```

### Monitoring Setup
Please review the configurations in monitoring dir and then execute ```make install-monitoring``` which will install Prometheus and Grafana into minikube. 

#### Grafana
On a separate terminal you can run port-forwarding to access the UI on your browser
```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana,app.kubernetes.io/instance=grafana" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 3000
```
On the UI to login you can get admin credentials by running.
```
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
```

#### Prometheus
On a separate terminal you can run port-forwarding to access the UI on your browser
```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus,app.kubernetes.io/instance=prometheus" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090
```
